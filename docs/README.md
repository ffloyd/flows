Small and fast ruby framework for implementing railway-like operations.
By design it is close to [Trailblazer::Operation](http://trailblazer.to/gems/operation/2.0/) and [Dry::Transaction](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-transaction/),
but has simpler and flexible DSLs for defining operations and matching results. Also `flows` is faster.

`flows` has no production dependencies so it can be used with any framework and cannot bring dependency incompatibilities.

Rest of the documentation will be here when v0.4.0 be released.
