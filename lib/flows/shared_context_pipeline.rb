module Flows
  # Abstraction for organizing calculations in a shared data context.
  #
  # Let's start with example. Let's say we have to calculate `(a + b) * (a - b)`:
  #
  #     class Claculation < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       step :calc_left_part
  #       step :calc_right_part
  #       step :calc_result
  #
  #       def calc_left_part(a:, b:, **)
  #         ok(left: a + b)
  #       end
  #
  #       def calc_right_part(a:, b:, **)
  #         ok(right: a - b)
  #       end
  #
  #       def calc_result(left:, right:, **)
  #         ok(result: left * right)
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  #     x = Calculation.call(a: 1, b: 2)
  #     # x is a `Flows::Result::Ok`
  #
  #     x.unwrap
  #     # => { a: 1, b: 2, left: 3, right: -1, result: -3 }
  #
  # It works by the following rules:
  #
  # * execution context is a Hash with Symbol keys.
  # * input becomes initial execution context.
  # * steps are executed in a provided order.
  # * actual execution context becomes a step input.
  # * step implementation is a public method with the same name.
  # * step implementation must return {Flows::Result} ({Flows::Result::Helpers} already included).
  # * Result Object data will be merged to shared context after each step execution.
  # * If returned Result Object is successful - next step will be executed,
  #   in the case of the last step a calculation will be finished
  # * If returned Result Object is failure - a calculation will be finished
  # * When calculation is finished a Result Object will be returned:
  #     * result will have the same type and status as in the last executed step result
  #     * result wull have a full execution context as data
  #
  # ## Mutation Steps
  #
  # You may use a different step definition way:
  #
  #     class MyClass < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       mut_step :hello
  #
  #       def hello(ctx)
  #         ctx[:result] = 'hello'
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # When you use `mut_step` DSL method you define a step with different rules for implementation:
  #
  # * step implementation receives _one_ argument and it's your execution context in a form of a mutable Hash
  # * step implementation can modify execution context
  # * if step implementation returns
  #     * "truly" value - it makes step successful with default status `:ok`
  #     * "falsey" value - it makes step failure with default status `:err`
  #     * {Result} - it works like for standard step, but data is ignored. Only result type and status have effect.
  #
  # ## Tracks & Routes
  #
  # In some situations you may want some branching in a mix. Let's provide an example for a common problem
  # when you have to do some additional steps in case of multiple types of errors.
  # Let's say report to some external system:
  #
  #     class SafeFetchComment < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       step :fetch_post, routes(
  #         match_ok => :next,
  #         match_err => :handle_error
  #       )
  #       step :fetch_comment, routes(
  #         match_ok => :next,
  #         match_err => :handle_error
  #       )
  #
  #       track :handle_error do
  #         step :report_to_external_system
  #         step :write_logs
  #       end
  #
  #       # steps implementations here
  #     end
  #
  # Let's describe how `routes(...)` and `track` DSL methods work.
  #
  # Each step has a router. Router is defined by a hash and `router(...)` method itself is
  # a (almost) shortcut to {Flows::Flow::Router::Custom} constructor. By default each step has the following
  # router definition:
  #
  #     {
  #       match_ok => :next, # next step is calculated by DSL, this symbol will be substituted in a final router
  #       match_err => :end  # `:end` means stop execution
  #     }
  #
  # Hash provided in `router(...)` method will override default hash to make a final router.
  #
  # Because of symbols with special behavior (`:end`, `:next`) you cannot name your steps or tracks
  # `:next` or `:end`. And this is totally ok because it is reserved words in Ruby.
  #
  # By the way, you can route not only to tracks, but also to steps. And by using `match_ok(status)` and
  # `match_err(status)` you can have different routes for different statuses of successful or failure results.
  #
  # Steps defined inside a track are fully isolated. The simple way is to think about track as a totally
  # separate pipeline. You have to explicitly enter to it. And explicitly return from it to root-level steps
  # if you want to continue execution.
  #
  # If you feel it's too much verbose to route many steps to the same track you can do something like this:
  #
  #     class SafeFetchComment < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       def self.safe_step(name)
  #         step name, routes(
  #           match_ok => :next,
  #           match_err => :handle_error
  #         )
  #       end
  #
  #       safe_step :fetch_post
  #       safe_step :fetch_comment
  #
  #       track :handle_error do
  #         step :report_to_external_system
  #         step :write_logs
  #       end
  #
  #       # steps implementations here
  #     end
  #
  # ## Wrappers
  #
  # Sometimes you have to execute some steps inside SQL-transaction or something like this.
  # Most frameworks allow to do it in the following approach:
  #
  #     SQLDataBase.transaction do
  #       # your steps are executed here
  #       # special error must be executed to cancel the transaction
  #     end
  #
  # It's impossible to do with just step or track DSL. That's why `wrap` DSL method has been added.
  # Let's review it on example:
  #
  #     class MySCP < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       step :some_preparations
  #       wrap :in_transaction do
  #         step :action_a
  #         step :action_b
  #       end
  #
  #       def in_transaction(ctx, meta, &block)
  #         result = nil
  #
  #         ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
  #           result = block.call
  #
  #           raise ActiveRecord::Rollback if result.err?
  #         end
  #
  #         result
  #       end
  #
  #       # step implementations here
  #     end
  #
  # `wrap` DSL method receives name and block. Inside block you can define steps and tracks.
  #
  # `wrap` makes an isolated track and step structure.
  # You cannot route between wrapped and unwrapped steps and tracks.
  # One exception - you can route to the first wrapped step.
  #
  # The same wrapper with the same name can be used multiple times in the same operation:
  #
  #     class MySCP < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       step :some_preparations
  #       wrap :in_transaction do
  #         step :action_a
  #         step :action_b
  #       end
  #       step :some_calculations
  #       wrap :in_transaction do
  #         step :action_c
  #         step :action_d
  #       end
  #
  #       # ...
  #     end
  #
  # Unlike step implementations wrapper implementation has access to a shared meta (can be useful for plugins).
  #
  # You may think about steps and tracks inside wrapper as a nested pipeline.
  # Wrapper implementation receives mutable data context, metadata and block.
  # Block execution (`block.call`) returns a result object of the executed "nested pipeline".
  #
  # When you route to `:end` inside wrapper - you're leaving wrapper, **not** the whole pipeline.
  #
  # From the execution perspective wrapper is a single step. The step name is the first wrapped step name.
  #
  # `wrap` itself also can have overriden routes table:
  #
  #     wrap :in_transaction, routes(match_ok => :next, match_err => :end) do
  #       # steps...
  #     end
  #
  # Like a step, wrapper implementation must return {Flows::Result}.
  # Result is processed with the same approach as for normal step.
  # **Do not modify result returned from block - build a new one if needed.
  # Otherwise mutation steps can be broken.**
  #
  # ## Callbacks and metadata
  #
  # You may want to have some logic to execute before all steps, or after all, or before each, or after each.
  # For example to inject generalized execution process logging.
  # To achieve this you can use callbacks:
  #
  #     class MySCP < Flows::SharedContextPipeline
  #       before_all do |klass, data, meta|
  #         # you can modify execution data context and metadata here
  #         # return value will be ignored
  #       end
  #
  #       after_all do |klass, pipeline_result, data, meta|
  #         # you can modify execution data context and metadata here
  #         # you must return a final result object here
  #         # if no modifications needed - just return provided pipeline_result
  #       end
  #
  #       before_each do |klass, step_name, data, meta|
  #         # you can modify execution data context and metadata here
  #         # return value will be ignored
  #       end
  #
  #       after_each do |klass, step_name, step_result, data, meta|
  #         # you can modify execution data context and metadata here
  #         # return value will be ignored
  #         #
  #         # callback executed after context is updated with result data
  #         # (in the case of normal steps, mutation steps update context directly)
  #         #
  #         # DO NOT MODIFY RESULT OBJECT HERE - IT CAN BROKE MUTATION STEPS
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # Metadata - is a Hash which is shared between step executions.
  # This hash becomes metadata of a final {Flows::Result}.
  #
  # Metadata is designed to store non-business data such as execution times,
  # some library specific data, and so on.
